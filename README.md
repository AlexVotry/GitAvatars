## Development server

Run `npm start` for a nodejs server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4000/`.

This app makes api calls to Github showing avatars of users. It is organized by repos so there are some duplicate users with more than one repo.

If you hover over any user with the name beginning with "a" or "A" you will see a short list of their followers.

If you click on any other user, you will get some details about them.

There is a previous and next button at the bottom.

If you want to find repos based on user, topic or language just click on the filter drop-down menu and choose the filter, then type in the search box what you want to find.

Click on the "AvatarGits" to reset to original state.
